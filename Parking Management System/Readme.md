## Overview

This project was developed in our sophomore year for the System and Analysis Design course. The **Automated Parking Management System** is a software solution designed to facilitate efficient parking space allocation in parking lots. The system allows users to park their vehicles in a systematic way by assigning them a parking slot after inserting their Vehicle Bluebook. The system generates a parking ticket at the time of entry, and upon exit, users receive a cash memo detailing the parking bill based on the duration of the parking.

## Key Features:
1. **Parking Slot Assignment**: 
   - Users are assigned parking slots in a systematic manner based on the availability of spaces.
   
2. **Parking Ticket Generation**: 
   - A ticket is generated at the time of parking, containing details such as vehicle information and entry time.
   
3. **Billing System**:
   - A parking bill is generated upon exit, based on the duration the vehicle has been parked.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - A simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to park and retrieve their vehicles.

## Software Design

The software architecture is designed to be scalable and easy to maintain. By using UML diagrams, we were able to create a modular and efficient system design that streamlines both the parking process and the billing operations.
